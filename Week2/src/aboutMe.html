    <p>Hi! I'm Abdullah Zameek and I come from Sri Lanka(a little island somewhere in the Indian Ocean) and I'm currently a sophomore/second year at New York University Abu Dhabi.
    I study Computer Science with concentrations in Math and Interactive Media Arts but I'm also interested in a myriad of topics that range from politics to the perfect combination of sugar and ice in 
    bubble tea. As a passionate technoholic, I'm looking to dive deep into the field of computer security, especially  the aspects related to offensive security, cryptography and 
    the intersection between computer security and law. 
    
    When I'm not busy coding (or debugging, which is most of the time), I enjoy playing Pokemon (as a die-hard Nintendo fan since I was 12), taking walks down random streets
    in search of the next best onigiri(or shawarma), and experimenting with different ingredients in the kitchen.
    </p>
